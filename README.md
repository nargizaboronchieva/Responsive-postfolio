Unit 02 CSS and Bootstrap Homework: Responsive Portfolio

My website has responsive design, it means that the website render well on a variety of devices and window or screen sizes. 


1. Using Bootstrap CSS Framework i have created a mobile responsive portfolio. 

* Following files were created: `index.html`, `portfolio.html` and `contact.html`.

* Using Bootstrap,i developed website which have following items:

   * A navbar

   * A responsive layout

   * Responsive images

2. 

* in this work i have used Bootstrap's grid system (containers, rows, and columns).

* On an `xs` screen, content takes up the entire screen. On `sm` and larger screens, you should have some margins on the left and right sides of the screen.

* Navbar is consistent on each page.

* Navbar on each page contains links to Home/About, Contact, and Portfolio pages.

* All links are working.

Here is screenshots from each page:
